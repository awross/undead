	<font face='verdana' color='white'><big><big><b>Overview</b> 
	</big></big><br> 
	Humans Vs. Zombies is essentially a game of tag with 2 teams....
	Humans, and Zombies. All players start off as humans, with the
	exception of a set number who have volunteered, and are chosen to be
	Original Zombie(s). The Zombie(s) will start the 'infection' by
	tagging, or &#8220;feeding on&#8221;, members of the Human team. The Zombies must
	tag a Human at least once every 3 days; otherwise they 'starve-out',
	and are then out of normal gameplay. Humans may defend themselves fom
	Zombies with approved equipment (listed below).
	<br> 
	<br> 
	The game will run ALL day, EACH day, from
	the starting
	date until the posted
	ending time for the final stand.
	<br> 
	<br> 
	<big><b>Objective
	</b></big><br> 
	The Zombies win if/when all Human players have been turned into
	Zombies, or by preventing the Humans from escaping at the <b>Final
	Stand</b>. The Humans can win either by outlasting all the
	Zombies (so
	that they 'starve-out'), or by escaping them at the <b>Final
	Stand</b>.
